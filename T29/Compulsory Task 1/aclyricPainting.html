    <h2>9 Aclyric Painting Techniques</h2>
    <p>The great thing about acrylic paint is that, unlike watercolour, it does not require a specialist canvas. Acrylic
      paint can be used on most surfaces and is commonly used on paper and fabrics as well as canvas. Don’t be afraid to
      experiment with different surfaces and acrylic techniques.</p>

    <h3>1. Dry brush</h3>
    <p>This is quite self-explanatory – simply apply paint onto your canvas with a dry brush. This technique is great if
      you wanted a highly pigmented stroke of colour with rough, scratchy unrefined edges.</p>

    <h3>2. Washing</h3>
    <p>Washing makes your acrylic colours more translucent. This technique emulates watercolour, but it sets
      permanently. Just add a little water to your acrylic paints and experiment with some effects.</p>

    <h3>3. Stippling</h3>
    <p>Stippling is based on a technique initially used for printing in the early 1500s by Gulio Campagnola. Apply the
      head of your brush to your surface with a repetitive dabbing motion to create this effect. You can use stippling
      to separate colour through individual strokes of pigment. Stippling is similar to pointillism, which tends to be
      more precise.</p>

    <h3>4. Pouring</h3>
    <p>This fantastic technique is simple to execute and allows you to create some stunning works of abstract art.
      Choose the colours you’d like to use and individually mix them with a pouring medium. After this step you have two
      options:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>You can pour your colours individually onto the canvas</li>
      <li>You can pour all the colours into a container, then put the canvas on top, right side facing down, flip it so
        that the right side of the canvas is upwards and the container of paint is on top, facing down. Slowly release
        the container and move the paint around the canvas.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>5. Splattering</h3>
    <p>This technique is about colour, expression and embracing the chaotic nature of life. The technique is achieved by
      wetting your brush in water, before dipping it into an acrylic pigment of your choice before flicking/splatter
      your soaked brush onto the canvas.</p>
    <p>Jackson Pollock was a prominent figure in the abstract expressionist movement and he was known for using the
      splatter technique to achieve bespoke pieces.</p>

    <h3>6. Dabbing</h3>
    <p>This can be achieved by using a stiff bristle brush or paper towel. Paint is applied with light and fast
      pressure. Dabbing adds movement to your painting and is often used to illustrate bushes or greenery.</p>

    <h3>7. Palette Knife</h3>
    <p>This technique can be used in both acrylic and oil mediums. It is achieved by loading a palette knife with paint
      and applying it on to the canvas with the palette knife. This will create great texture.</p>

    <h3>8. Detailing</h3>
    <p>Detailing is accomplished by using a fine brush, moderately wetting it so it maintains a pointy form. The brush
      is then used in a similar way as a pen or pencil. You can use this technique to add intricate detail to your
      paintings.</p>

    <h3>9. Underpainting</h3>
    <p>Underpainting – also referred to as “dead colouring” – is used to create a foundation for the artist to layer
      colour on. It is highly useful for building contrast and tonal values. Underpainting can be utilised to create
      tonal dominance within the painting through uniting.</p>
