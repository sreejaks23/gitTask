    <p>Ever since I can remember I’ve always had a pencil in my hand drawing some kind of picture. As a child I remember
      drawing a lot of houses, mainly pretty thatched cottages… know idea why, or where my love for drawing came from.
      As I got older though, I began to draw a lot of portraits. It wasn’t just drawing though, I’ve enjoyed sewing,
      making paper crafts, jewellery, candles, salt-dough, baking and clay are just a few I can think of that I have
      explored over the years. I’ve experimented with many types of art mediums over the years, one of my favourites is
      <b>acrylic paint</b>.</p>
