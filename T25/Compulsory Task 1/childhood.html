  <h1>Hobbies</h1>

    <h2>Arts and Crafts</h2>

      <p>Ever since I can remember I’ve always had a pencil in my hand drawing some kind of picture. As a child I remember drawing a lot of houses, mainly pretty thatched cottages… know idea why, or where my love for drawing came from. As I got older though, I began to draw a lot of portraits. It wasn’t just drawing though, I’ve enjoyed sewing, making paper crafts, jewellery, candles, salt-dough, baking and clay are just a few I can think of that I have explored over the years. I’ve experimented with many types of art mediums over the years, one of my favourites is <b>acrylic paint</b>.</p>

    <h2>Playing Badminton</h2>

      <p>I used to play <b>Badminton</b> every evening once i get back from school.</p>

  <h1>Toys</h1>

    <h2>Barbie Doll</h2>

    <p>One of my favourite toys was a <em>Barbie Doll</em>. It was gifted to me by my parents on my 6th birthday. I vividly remember, it was packed in a beautiful pink box when my parents gave it to me. The box had ‘Birthday Pink Barbie” written on top of it. When I opened the box I saw a very pretty Barbie Doll wearing a pink gown, matching shoes and few additional dresses with a comb and makeup kit. I fell in love with it the moment I saw it.</p>

    <h2>Building Blocks</h2>

      <p>It was fun playing with <em>building blocks</em>. I used to make house, train using building blocks.</p>
