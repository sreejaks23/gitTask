Pseudo code solution:

BEGIN
request user to input their name
store name into variable called "firstName"
	print "Hello "firstName""
END


BEGIN
request user to input their age
store age into a variable called "age"
find the year the person was born
store the year into a variable called "year"
	print "Based on your age of "age", it looks like you were born in "year" "
END
