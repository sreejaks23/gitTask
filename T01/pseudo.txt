Pseudo code solution:

BEGIN
request random letter from the user
repeat until user inputs a number
if the letter mathces with vowels
	print total number of vowels
END


BEGIN
read arbitrary number of integers
	return average of all the even numbers
	return average of all the odd numbers
END

	
BEGIN
read list of names
	print names in alphabetical order
END
